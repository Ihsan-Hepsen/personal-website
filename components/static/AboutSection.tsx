            <p>
                As a full-stack software engineer and web developer, I have extensive experience working with various technologies,
                including Java Spring, React.js, and TypeScript. I have built several web applications using these technologies,
                and I'm comfortable working on both the front-end and back-end parts of the stack.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                In addition to deploying applications to cloud services like Google App Engine and Azure, I have also
                built microservices using containerization technologies like Docker, ensuring the
                scalability and maintainability of the services.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Collaborating on more than 9 real-world projects has given me the chance to work with teams of accomplished
                individuals and perfect my ability to work collectively. As a result of these ventures, I acquired
                knowledge and expertise on how software development operates; thus, I am eager to apply this invaluable
                experience working collaboratively with other seasoned professionals.
